# **NetLearn-C: A From-Scratch Machine Learning Library in C**

**NetLearn-C **is a foundational machine learning and neural network library implemented entirely in C. It emphasizes clarity, modular design, and educational valueâ€”ideal for those interested in building AI systems from the ground up, without dependencies or frameworks.

This library mirrors the structure found in professional ML libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch, but is handcrafted for deep understanding and maximum control.

## **ðŸ“š Educational Foundation**

This library was built while studying the open-access textbook:

Mathematics for Machine Learning
By Marc Peter Deisenroth, A. Aldo Faisal, and Cheng Soon Ong

It serves as the theoretical backbone of the implementation. Each algorithm in this library was carefully aligned with the concepts covered in that book.
